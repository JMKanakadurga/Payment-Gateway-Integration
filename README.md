This task was done under the Web Development and Designing Internship (GRIP) at the Sparks Foundation.

--->About the task

The task assigned was to create a website with a payment gateway integration.I have designed a website for donating <br>towards the Covid-19 relief funds.

--->Design flow of the website is as follows:

-> Create a simple website where payment gateway is integrated.There will be a simple donate button on homepage.<br>
-> On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g.credit card, Paypal, etc.<br>
-> Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount.<br>
-> Create your own temporary / sandbox / testing accounts with 3rd party for integrations.<br>
-> Host the website at 000webhost, github.io, heroku app or any other free hosting provider.
